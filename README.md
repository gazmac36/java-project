# Java Project Definition - Paired 
## Totally *not* Gumtree

Goal: Create a web application in Spark with Hibernate/Java back end.
### MVP
You are required to write a web application for a company listing classified ads. The company would like to give users of their site
the ability to create and post adverts to their listings.
Adverts should require a Title, Description, category and asking price.

Users should be able to:
- View all adverts posted.
- View all adverts in a category.
- Create and post adverts to specific categories.
- Delete their own adverts.

### Project Extensions

* Post comments on adverts.
* Be able to create a user and store favourite listings.
